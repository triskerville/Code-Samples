# Code-Samples [Tristan Baskerville]
This repo serves to showcase various works during my time at DigiPen, and along with projects I have worked on since.

## C++
Current examples include code from my Data Structures course, and a example engine stub created to showcase Engine Architechure and strong C++ principles. More examples to come.

## Example Reports
Small example reports from the Advanced Real-time Rendering Techniques course I took during my senior year.

## Media
Example videos of graphics projects from several courses. If any of the previews are broken, the individual videos can be downloaded and played as expected.
